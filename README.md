# Horiseon-alt-update

Made the code user friendly.

Updated both the index.html and style.css by removing redundent or repeated class properties into a single class.
Simplified class naming convention, and utilised semantic html tags in place of div and classes in the index.html page.
Cleaned up the HTML markup by doing the following:
- applied indentation where needed
- remove redundant tags
- updated tags with semantic tags where it is applicable
- combined multiple classes with similar css properties into one class, 
  or target specific tags in place of classes where nescessary.
  (applied only when HTML markup has similar formatting)
